          <p>I went down to the river, <br>
             I set down on the bank.<br>
             I tried to think but couldn&apos;t, <br>
             So I jumped in and sank.
          </p>
          <p>I came up once and hollered&excl;<br>
             I came up twice and cried&excl;<br>
             If that water hadn&apos;t a&ndash;been so cold <br>
             I might&apos;ve sunk and died.
          </p>
          <p>But it was Cold in that water&excl; It was cold&excl;</p>
          <p>I took the elevator <br>
             Sixteen floors above the ground. <br>
             I thought about my baby <br>
             And thought I would jump down.
          </p>
          <p>I stood there and I hollered&excl; <br>
             I stood there and I cried&excl; <br>
             If it hadn&apos;t a&ndash;been so high <br>
             I might&apos;ve jumped and died.
          </p>
          <p>But it was High up there&excl; It was high&excl;</p>
          <p>So since I&apos;m still here livin&apos;, <br>
             I guess I will live on. <br>
             I could&apos;ve died for love&ndash;&ndash;<br>
             But for livin&apos; I was born
          </p>
          <p>Though you may hear me holler,<br>
             And you may see me cry&ndash;&ndash;<br>
             I&apos;ll be dogged, sweet baby,<br>
             If you gonna see me die.
          </p>
          <p>Life is fine&excl; Fine as wine&excl; Life is fine&excl;</p>
